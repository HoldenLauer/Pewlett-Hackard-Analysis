# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the project was to use SQL to determine the number of employees entering retirement age and are also able to enter into the mentorship program. The retiring employees by title information will show the titles of all employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955. The mentorship eligible employees were sorted by employees born in 1965. With this information within our query we can create csv files with all the employee information needed.
## Results
- A total of 90,398 employees are about to retire from the company.
- Only two managers are retiring, minimizing need to train new leadership.
- The number of employees eligible for the mentorship program are few (1549) in comparison to the number of employees retiring.
- The bulk of the retiring employees are "Senior Engineers" (33%) or "Senior Staff" (31%), indicating the departure of a significant portion of experiential knowledge. Recruiting will need to work hard to counter this brain-drain.

## Summary
According to the analysis of the data provided in the CSV files, there may be as many as 90,398 employees retiring within the next year. This is a very large number of vacancies to fill; however, Pewlett Hackard may be able to save some time and money in the long run by conducting a review of needed roles and positions. Without that review by the company it's hard to calculate the amount of roles needed to be refilled.
There are 1549 "qualified, retirement-ready employees" for the mentorship program. However, without knowing how many locations these employees are spread over, it's hard to begin to design such a project. Location information was, unfortunately, not included in the original CSVs. Also, the emplolyees would need to be interviewed to see if they are right for the mentorship position.
Two additional tables that could prove useful in preparing for the coming "Silver Tsunami" are as follows:

- A table showing the total salaries of all the retiring employees. The grand total is in the billions. As long as PH spends less than this on hiring replacements, it's saved money.
![retiring dept count](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110861876/192391161-328e5c3f-62d0-4d65-93fe-d3e8bf852e51.png)
- A table showing how many employees are retiring by department, which indicates that Development and Production teams are going to see the biggest losses.
